<p style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 20px;">If you are creating an A/B test between components in a single unit, you'll want to find the vertical file that corresponds to the unit. &nbsp;This vertical file will contain two component (these could be html, problem or video) url names that will correspond to the components in that unit. &nbsp;Please click here to view detailed instructions on how to create this kind of A/B test.</p>
<h3>Creating an A/B test between components within a unit:</h3>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Go to Studio and create your section, subsection, and unit.</li>
<li>Add two components to this unit.<br /><br />Note: They can be the same kind of component or different. There can also be multiple components within a unit.<br /><br />Here is an image of what you should have at this point in Courseware:<br /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/unit_with_two_problem_components.jpg" /></li>
<li>Export your course by clicking on Tools &gt; Export and then clicking on the blue button to export your course's content.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/tools___export.jpg" /></li>
<li>Unzip the exported .tar.gz file you receive.</li>
<li>Open an editing program, such as TextWrangler or SublimeText.</li>
<li>Open the folder that contains all of your course's files.</li>
<li>In Studio, go to the unit that you want to create the A/B test in.&nbsp; Every unit will have a Unit Location module in Studio.&nbsp; Note the Unit Identifier string for this unit.&nbsp; Set this information aside for the moment.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/note_the_unit_identifier_string.jpg" /></li>
<li>Now go to the live version of your course and go to the corresponding unit.</li>
<li>For the components in question, click on "Staff Debug Info".&nbsp; Copy the location URL.&nbsp; The location URL will start with "i4x://" and may look something like this:<br /><br /><code></code>i4x://StanfordOnline/OpenEdX/problem/821c9feed6594c0b8fea90e97a7b33bd<br /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/click_staff_debug_info_and_copy_location.jpg" /></li>
<li>Go back to the editing program and find the string in the vertical folder of your course file that corresponds to the Unit Identifier string you noted in step 7. Open this file.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/vertical_file_in_course_file.jpg" /></li>
<li>Insert a &lt;split_test&gt; tag after the &lt;vertical&gt; tag.&nbsp; Close this with a &lt;/split_test&gt; tag before the closing &lt;/vertical&gt; tag.<br /><br />Here is how your vertical file might look before editing it:<br /><br /><code>&lt;vertical display_name="split3"&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;problem url_name="821c9feed6594c0b8fea90e97a7b33bd"/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;problem url_name="50938f7b9ca64d0d9956f8ff46f781f4"/&gt;<br />&lt;/vertical&gt;</code><br /><br />Here is how the above vertical file looks after I've inserted a &lt;split_test&gt; tag:<br /><br /><code>&lt;vertical display_name="split3"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;split_test user_partition_id="0" group_id_to_child='{"0": "i4x://StanfordOnline/OpenEdX/problem/821c9feed6594c0b8fea90e97a7b33bd", "2": "i4x://StanfordOnline/OpenEdX/problem/50938f7b9ca64d0d9956f8ff46f781f4"}'&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;problem url_name="821c9feed6594c0b8fea90e97a7b33bd"/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;problem url_name="50938f7b9ca64d0d9956f8ff46f781f4"/&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/split_test&gt;<br />&lt;/vertical&gt;</code></li>
<li>In layman's speak, the above is basically saying, "We have a user partition with the name (or ID) of "0" specified elsewhere.&nbsp; This user partition has two children, "0" and "2".&nbsp; For the child "0", show them this component at this location ID.&nbsp; For the child "2", show them this component that exists at this other location ID."</li>
<li>Save your change to the vertical file after you make the above edits.</li>
<li>Zip your file back up as a .tar.gz file.</li>
<li>Import this file back into your course by going to Tools &gt; Import.</li>
<li>When you are done, your unit in Studio will no longer be editable and will look something like this:<br /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/end_result_in_studio.jpg" /></li>
<li>The end result in Courseware will look something like this:<br /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/finished_product_with_group_0_dropdown.jpg" /></li>
<li>Students will not see the drop-down menu. Rather, students who end up (note this assignment is randomly assigned and cannot be specified) in one group will see the component specified for that group, and students in the other group will only see the component that has been specified for that group.</li>
<li>If you export and edit your course file again at a later time, you might notice that the vertical file you edited and imported now looks different.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/updated_vertical_file_after_exporting.jpg" /><br /><br />This file changes automatically and a new split_test file is created to define the behavior you set up in your test.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/new_split_file_created_for_this_vertical_ab_test.jpg" /></li>
