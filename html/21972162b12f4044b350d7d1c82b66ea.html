<p>Iframing in course content is easy and creates a slick view. &nbsp;To do this, first upload your file to your course. &nbsp;Go to Content &gt; Files &amp; Uploads. &nbsp;Browse the files on your computer and find the one you want. &nbsp;Upload your file. &nbsp;After you do that, you'll see a window displaying a short URL for your file. &nbsp;Copy this short URL. &nbsp;Go to a unit you have created in a subsection in your Course Outline. &nbsp;Click to add an HTML component to it. &nbsp;Once that opens, click "Edit" and then click "HTML". &nbsp;From here, you can now enter the following iframe tag:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;iframe src="http://yourshortURL.PDF" width="800" height="600"/&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Save your changes to the component and you will now see an embedded document in the unit. &nbsp;Feel free to adjust the width and height as you see fit.</p>
