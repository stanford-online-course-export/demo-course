<h2>categories</h2>
<p>Discussions are by default all added to the same single category in the Discussion page: "General".&nbsp; If you'd like to organize discussions by category, you can create additional categories.&nbsp; To do that, click on "Settings" in the menu bar at the top of your page in Studio and select "Advanced Settings". Find the policy key for discussion_topics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/advanced_settings.jpg" /><br /><img alt="" src="/static/policy_key_topics.jpg" /></p>
<p>The field on the right is editable and is where you can add the different categories you'd like to have.</p>
<p>By default, you are started with the following value for the "General" category:</p>
<p><code>{ "General": { "id": "i4x-StanfordOnline-OpenEdX-course-Demo" } } </code></p>
<p>Copy everything that is inside of the two outermost curly brackets and paste them after "...-Demo" }" but before the very last curly bracket.&nbsp; Do this as many times as you'd like.&nbsp; Change "General" to a topic title of your choosing, and append a string to the ID value, so that your new discussion topic also has a new URL that it will live under, but still within the Discussion page.&nbsp; The screenshot above is an example of how this might look after adding two new discussion topics, one for "Suggestions" and another for "Advanced Topics".&nbsp; Here is the code for reference:</p>
<p><code>{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;quot;General&amp;quot;: {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;i4x-StanfordOnline-OpenEdX-course-Demo&amp;quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;quot;Suggestions&amp;quot;: {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;i4x-StanfordOnline-OpenEdX-course-Demo_suggestions&amp;quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;quot;Advanced Topics&amp;quot;: {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;i4x-StanfordOnline-OpenEdX-course-Demo_advanced&amp;quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />}</code></p>
<p>If you save your changes, you'll then be able to see these new discussion categories by heading over to the Discussion page and clicking on the arrow to the right side of where it says, "Show All Discussions".</p>
