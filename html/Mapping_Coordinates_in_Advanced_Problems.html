<h2>Tip for Mapping coordinates in advanced problems</h2>
<p>One bit of information that may help you when you are tailoring these problems is that some of them rely on coordinate mapping. &nbsp;You can determine the coordinates of an image by starting from the top left corner of an image. &nbsp;The top left corner of any image will have 0,0 as its starting coordinates, with the first 0 referring to a plotted point on the horizontal placement (or x-axis) of your image, and the second 0 referring to a plotted point on the vertical placement (or y-axis) of your image. &nbsp;In this way, you can draw shapes with the coordinates, which you specify in your code, and you can use that identified space to have some action occur there.&nbsp;</p>
