<h2>Built-in discussion feature</h2>
<p>Every OpenEdX course comes with a built-in discussion page, which your students can use to interact with each other.&nbsp; This page is also the best way for students to contact the course team.&nbsp; If you provide alternate methods for them to contact you through, that's all the better, but if you have no alternatives, then this allows for a public space within which they can ask a question and get an answer from someone on your course team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students should add [STAFF] to the subject heading of their discussion, so that you and your team can then easily search for [STAFF] discussions and respond to those needing your attention.</p>
