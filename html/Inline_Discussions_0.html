<h2>inline discussions</h2>
<p>These are the discussions that you can add to a specific unit in your Course Outline.&nbsp; Discussion components allow you and your students to have focused conversations within a unit, and can be a good way to have discussions around a particular bit of text, image, video or question or quiz.&nbsp; Discussions that are added to units also show up in the main Discussion page.</p>
<p>By default, the titles they take are a bit obscure. As a result, if you add a discussion component to a unit, it's a good idea to also edit the title of the discussion component's category.&nbsp; To do that, head to the subsection that you added a discussion component to.&nbsp; Click to edit the discussion component.</p>

<p>You'll see a "Category" and "Subcategory" field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Change these to something more meaningful to your course, and save your changes when you're done.&nbsp; For example, I have a discussion component added to the Images subsection.&nbsp; I've updated the category and subcategory names as you can see in this screenshot:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/changed.jpg" /></p>
<p>That then updates the Discussion page's options in the drop-down menu (and also displays as bread crumbs) across inline discussion posts, so that readers know where this discussion is coming from.&nbsp;</p>
