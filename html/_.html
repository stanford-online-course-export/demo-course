<h2>Navigating your course</h2>
<p>Getting familiar with the navigational structure of your online course will help you utilize the resources made available to you to the fullest extent.</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black;" alt="Navigation tabs" src="/static/standard_tabs.jpg" /></p>
<p>The leftmost tab is Courseware. &nbsp;This is where you will find your course's content. &nbsp;Most courses contain the following content in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pre-course survey</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Syllabus</li>
<li>Homework assignments</li>
<li>Quizzes</li>
<li>Midterm and final exams</li>
</ul>
<p>The next tab in your online course is the Course Info section. &nbsp;This is the tab your course will default to after you register. &nbsp;The professor introduces the course here, sets class expectations, and adds updates. &nbsp;Check here for pointers, changes and other important information about your course.</p>
<p>The Discussion tab allows you and your fellow classmates to share questions, comments, to elaborate on topics covered in the class or debate material. &nbsp;If a homework assignment or quiz question has you stumped, this is a great place to go to see how your classmates are going about addressing this question. &nbsp;Make sure to not share answers in this space, only tips and suggestions, if you wish to help your fellow classmates reach conclusions you may have reached sooner than them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wiki is for files you or classmates wish to add, to further enhance the course. &nbsp;Sometimes professors choose to use this place to provide links to files and downloadable content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Progress tab reflects your individual progress throughout the course. &nbsp;Use this to measure your strengths and weaknesses. &nbsp;Scores received for homework assignments, quizzes and exams all get posted here and tallied up, so that you can see how you are doing. &nbsp;If you notice a trend around a certain period during this course, help is available! &nbsp;Contact your instructor, email a TA, post a question in the Discussion section or reach out to a friend. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>subsections</h2>
<p>Subsections are found inside of sections your instructor has created under the Courseware tab. &nbsp;These help to organize course content and topics. &nbsp;Within a subsection, you will see one or more pages, called "units". &nbsp;You can have as many units in a subsection as you want. &nbsp;Each unit will contain components that you add to the unit. &nbsp;Units can have any many components in them as you wish.</p>
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid black;" alt="subsections and units" src="/static/subsections_and_units.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>Across the top of a subsection's page, notice the horizontal bar. &nbsp;If the left and right arrow tabs are grayed out and you only see one icon in this bar, then that indicates there is only a single page in this subsection. &nbsp;If you see multiple icons and a clickable arrow tab, that denotes that multiple pages exist in this subsection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the above example, there are four icons visible, indicating there are at least four pages in the Lesson 2 subsection.</p>
<p>Instructors may use multiple pages in subsections to insert video snippets, with quiz questions interjected between them, to ensure students are watching and understanding the content in these pages. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on what content exists on a page, the icon will vary. &nbsp;The most common icons you may encounter are noted below:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="Multiple Choice" src="/static/Multiple_Choice.jpg" /></td>
<td>This icon indicates you will see exercises (such as multiple choice or checkbox questions) on the page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="Video" src="/static/Video.jpg" /></td>
<td>This icon indicates you will see a video on the page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="PDF" src="/static/PDF.jpg" />&nbsp;</td>
<td>This icon indicates you will see a PDF or other uploaded document on the page.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The Discussion tab, as mentioned above, is where you as a student can share your thoughts, questions, brainstorm ideas, and otherwise interact with your fellow classmates, as well as the instructor and TAs. &nbsp;If you have some insight into a topic that you would like to share with classmates, post it here. &nbsp;Anything that isn't meshing for you is perfect fodder for this area of your online course. &nbsp;Chances are, if you have a question about something, someone else does, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure a discussion gets noticed by the instructor, TAs, or the Course Operations team, make sure to add [STAFF] to the subject heading of your discussion. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black;" alt="Discussion" src="/static/Discussion.jpg" /></p>
<p>Your discussion page will show discussions in a left column. &nbsp;By default, discussions having the most recent activity will display first in the list. &nbsp;You can also sort by votes or comments. &nbsp;If there are comments or discussions you haven't read, you'll see the number bubbles display in blue next to the discussion's subject heading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Votes are added by yourself and fellow classmates. &nbsp;If you find a particular discussion or reply especially useful, click on the "+" button beside the subject heading to upvote it. &nbsp;If you just want to keep track of a discussion, click on the star icon in the upper corner of the discussion to follow it. &nbsp; To see all discussions you're following:</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>Click on the arrow carrot next to where it says "Show All Discussions"&nbsp;</li>
<li>Select "Posts I'm Following"&nbsp;</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>To get an email digest with updates made to all discussions you've decided to follow, go to the Discussion home page (accessible from any discussion page by clicking on the home icon) and check the box beside "Receive updates."</p>
