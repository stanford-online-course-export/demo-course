<p>Here we have a temple from Angkor Thom.&nbsp; If you click to view the full screen image, you can see more clearly and in greater detail how the temple is composed of thousands of individual rocks.&nbsp; The entire series of temples were composed of all of these individual pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, workers in Cambodia have painstakingly pieced back together many of the temples, bit by bit.&nbsp; While this is a job of epic scale, the workers' task is made a little easier by the fact that each rock is numbered, so in effect, what we have is a gigantic puzzle.</p>
