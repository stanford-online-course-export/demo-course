<h2>Introduction to Randomized Variables</h2>
<p>It is possible to randomize variables in a problem so that they change for each student, each attempt, or each reset of the problem. This can be useful as a countermeasure against the sharing of answers between students, or as a way to keep students from guess-and-checking their way to a correct answer.</p>
<p>Randomizing variables requires two steps. The first is to create&nbsp;a Python script that will randomize the appropriate values in your problem. To see sample code for this, take a look at the third Unit in this subsection. The second step is to change&nbsp;the problem component's Randomization setting to something other than the default, which is "Never." (Note &ndash; be careful not to change this setting when you aren't actually randomizing variables, as it makes interpreting the data for a problem much harder.) &nbsp;"Per Student" will show each student a different version of the problem, but that version will be consistent for each student. "On Reset" will show students a different version every time they click "Reset." And "Always" will show students a different version each time they click "Submit."</p>
