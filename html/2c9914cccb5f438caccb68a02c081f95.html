<h2 style="font-size: 16px;">Three LTI Examples: #2: Link to an External Grader</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">The second example links you to a page where you can then manually enter a grade for a student's work done externally from the course site's assignments.&nbsp; This can be very useful if your course includes some offline assignments.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">For example, you might require that your art students visit a museum for credit, or that your biology students intern at a medical lab.&nbsp; In that case, some external proof of your choosing would confirm that they had completed this requirement.&nbsp; This LTI component would then allow you to add this external graded item into the course, and add this credit to the other online graded items, thus adjusting their overall progress in the course.</p>
