<h2>Forum Moderating</h2>
<p>To get help with moderating discussions on the Discussion&nbsp; page, you might want to appoint your TA(s) or a student in the course to a forum administrator or forum moderator role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please note that by default, the course team is not enabled to edit or otherwise moderate discussions.</strong>&nbsp; You can, however, set this up by grabbing the email address or username of the person in question, and then heading over to the Instructor tab from the live version of your course.</p>
<p>Once there, click on "Try New Beta Dashboard" and click "Membership".&nbsp; In here, you'll see your course team members listed under "Course Staff".&nbsp; Change the drop-down menu to "Discussion Admins" (or "Discussion Moderators" or "Discussion Community TAs").&nbsp;&nbsp; This panel will be blank.&nbsp; Paste in the email address or username you grabbed earlier, then click "Add Discussion Admin".</p>

<p>You can see the privileges as they are extended to the three possible moderator roles in the table below:</p>

<table style="width: 500px;">
<tbody>
<tr><th>Privilege</th><th>Extended To</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Edit / delete posts</td>
<td>Admins, Moderators &amp; Community TAs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Review flagged posts</td>
<td>Admins, Moderators &amp; Community TAs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Close / reopen threads</td>
<td>Admins, Moderators &amp; Community TAs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Appoint others to moderation roles</td>

<tr>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One additional distinction to point out is that comments from anyone in the course team or anyone who is a discussion admin or discussion moderator will display "Staff" beside their names. Comments made by community TAs will display "Community TA" beside their names.</p>
