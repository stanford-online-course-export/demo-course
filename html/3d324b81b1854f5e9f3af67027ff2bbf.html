<p><strong>Purge Stream:</strong>&nbsp; In real ammonia processes, argon is often included as an inert gas in the feed stream because it is too expensive to separate argon from nitrogen, although it is fairly easy to separate argon from ammonia to obtain our pure product.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem with the above PFD can be seen when considering a balance on argon for the overall process: the process as drawn above <em>cannot operate at steady state!</em>&nbsp; The argon in the overall process will accumulate!&nbsp; Therefore, <strong><em>a fraction of the recycle stream needs to be purged while the remainder is recycled back to the reactor</em></strong>.&nbsp; Note that we will have to waste some small amount of unused reactants in this purge stream.&nbsp;</p>
