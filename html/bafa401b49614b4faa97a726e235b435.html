<p>This course is here to help make it easier to&nbsp;create your own course and navigate through&nbsp;it.&nbsp; Many instructors choose to start their courses off with an introductory video, introducing themselves and the course staff.&nbsp; Others include just a small bit of text explaining what is included in the Course Info page.</p>
<p>A helpful tool at your disposal for ensuring you've done all the things that need to be done before releasing your online course to the wild is the Checklist, found under the Tools menu at the top of your page in Studio.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/checklist.jpg" /></p>
<p>This page guides you through the process in an organized way, from setting up your course team and grading policies to setting up surveys, videos, discussions and more.</p>

Please note that OpenEdX uses a customized checklist, so what you see in Studio and the documentation may differ slightly.</p>
