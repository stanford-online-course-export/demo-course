<h2>setting up a/b testing on your course site</h2>
<p>A/B testing is a great way to see what works and what doesn't in a course.&nbsp; You may want to offer slight variations on&nbsp;practice problems&nbsp;to your students and see which ones lead to&nbsp;better results.&nbsp; Or you may want to show different video content - say a shorter versus a longer video - in order to see which ones students retain more information from. &nbsp;This function allows you to set up such a test in your course and see what happens when randomly assigned participants view one version versus another.</p>
<p>You can hold an A/B test between two different subsections, two different units or two different components. &nbsp;Click on the subsequent units and subsections to view illustrations of these kinds of A/B tests.</p>
