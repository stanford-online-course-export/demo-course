<p>By default, components have display names. &nbsp;These display names can be seen under the Settings tab when editing the component. &nbsp;When working with conditional content, even though only content that is set to display for a particular response will display, the display names for all components in a particular unit will show up in the horizontal navigation bar, unless the Display Name field has been left blank in the component's Settings tab.</p>
