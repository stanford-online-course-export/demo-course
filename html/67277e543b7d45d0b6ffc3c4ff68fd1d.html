<p>Inside this section, we have four&nbsp;subsections but only three will show in the lefthand column.&nbsp; You are currently viewing the second subsection, and cannot see the first because the first subsection has been hidden! To see the hidden subsection with three units, <a target="[object Object]" href="https://stage.class.stanford.edu/courses/StanfordOnline/OpenEdX/Demo/courseware/Hidden_Content/Subsection_1/">click here</a>. &nbsp;In the image below, you can see the subsection that is hidden, but you don't see it noted in the section to the left.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/Hidden_Subsection_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>How is this done?&nbsp; First, you create a subsection and add a unit (or units) to it, and then add a component (or multiple components) to that unit.&nbsp; Publish the unit.</p>
<p><strong>The following steps were updated on 10-22-14 due to changes in the platform.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While still viewing the unit, hover your mouse over the subsection link in the breadcrumb above your unit. &nbsp;Note the corresponding&nbsp;URL in the browser status bar. &nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="/static/hover_mouse_over_subsection_breadcrumb_in_unit_to_see_location_ID.png" alt="" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" preventdefault="function () {i.isDefaultPrevented=n;}" stoppropagation="function () {i.isPropagationStopped=n;}" stopimmediatepropagation="function () {i.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n;}" isdefaultprevented="function t() {return!1;}" ispropagationstopped="function t() {return!1;}" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t() {return!1;}" height="305" width="599" /><br /><br />The end string of that URL is the location ID for this subsection. Note the first three&nbsp;characters of that URL, which will follow the word "sequential". &nbsp;</p>
<p>After you've made a note of this string, click on "Tools" in the menu bar and select "Export". &nbsp;This will take you to a page in Studio where you can then export your entire course as a special zip file. &nbsp;Once that has downloaded to your computer, click to unzip this file and open it in a text-editing tool. &nbsp;If you have a Mac, one tool you might use is TextWrangler, which handles code edits in a very neat and orderly way. &nbsp;You could also edit this in something like SublimeText, TextMate, TextEdit or NotePad.</p>
<p>Go to your exported course file, and go to the sequential folder.&nbsp; The first&nbsp;three characters of the URL you noted earlier will tell you which sequential file to edit in your exported course file.</p>
<p>Open the sequential file in your editing program, and you'll see the XML file start with something like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;sequential display_name="Subsection 1"&gt;</code></p>
<p>All units you have added to this subsection will display beneath this tag as &lt;vertical&gt; tags.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add the following information to the &lt;sequential&gt; tag in the file:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">hide_from_toc="true" start="2013-01-28T22:33:00Z"</span></p>
<p>The end result is this:</p>
<p>&lt;sequential display_name="Subsection 1" hide_from_toc="true" start="2013-01-28T22:33:00Z"&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;vertical url_name="c74ed93121e6470c8b4a9d954bfc4a66"/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;vertical url_name="305fd6726c94406a860cc6d2ff6b0c38"/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;vertical url_name="d669b491f89048d3996ccc199e26275e"/&gt;<br />&lt;/sequential&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here's a screenshot of how my sequential file looks now:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/2_-_finished_version_of_your_sequential_xml_file.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;After you've edited your file, save your changes.&nbsp; Then, zip this file up and import it back into your course. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The subsection will no longer show up in the Courseware column or anywhere in the course, but if you&nbsp;add a link to it in your course, then&nbsp;people will be able to access the content via the link you provide.</p>

<p>Clicking the link will take you to the hidden subsection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to retrieve the link to the hidden subsection, go back to Studio and&nbsp;click on a unit in the subsection. &nbsp;Click on the "View Live Version" button. &nbsp;Copy the URL. &nbsp;You can use this URL to access your hidden subsection at any time.&nbsp;</p>
