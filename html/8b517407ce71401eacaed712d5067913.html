<h2>Three LTI Examples: #1: Link to an External Site</h2>
<p>This first example simply allows you to link your students to an external site.&nbsp; This can also be done through iframe tags, but iframes will not work in all cases (such as when trying to pull public http:// sites into the private https:// class framework).&nbsp; For this reason, LTI might be a helpful approach for linking this kind of content to your course.</p>
