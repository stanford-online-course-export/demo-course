<h2>Full Screen Image</h2>
<p>To add a full screen image to your unit, first upload your image to the Files &amp; Uploads page (found via the "Content" drop-down menu option).&nbsp; Copy the Embed URL for your image, then go to the Outline page to create a unit to add your image to.</p>
<p>Once you've created this unit, click on the "HTML" component option and select "Full Screen Image." You'll start off with this default image.&nbsp; Click on "HTML" to switch to HTML view of your component. Replace the end of the URL (the /stanford-hills-big.jpg part of the URL) with your own URL. Replace the text with your own text as well, if you'd like. "img alt="The Stanford Hills"" is what will display when someone hovers their mouse over the image.</p>
<p>Students can then click on this image to expand it to fill the screen. They'll then see options for zooming in, zooming out, or exiting the full screen view. If the image is so large that not all of it is visible, then students will additionally be able to click on the image and drag it around, in order to display a particular part of the image.</p>
