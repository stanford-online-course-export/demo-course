<h2>Inline Text Input Problem Example Instructions</h2>
<p>To have an inline text input problem, you can use the following code and edit the values to make it your own.</p>
<p>The thing to note here, though, is that in order for participants to get the problem right with the current code, they will need to get both input fields right before they see a green checkmark in either input, so even if one response they give is right but the other is not, both will show an "X" if they click to submit their answers.</p>
<p>That said, with an additional definition of "acceptable" responses, you can add a little flexibility to what response options are allowed as "correct".</p>
<p>The code below is what you could use to create this kind of problem. &nbsp;You'll want to edit the content highlighted in <span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span> with the answer responses you want to set up as correct. The content in <span style="color: #0000ff;">blue</span> is where you can add your own custom message for people to see after an answer is not acceptable, but make sure it does not contain any special characters like quotation marks. &nbsp;The <span style="color: #008000;">green</span>-colored content below is what you'll want to edit for your question prompt.</p>
<p><code>&lt;problem&gt;&nbsp;<br /></code>&lt;script type="loncapa/python"&gt;&nbsp;<br />def check_function(expect,answer):&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;expect = ['<span style="color: #ff0000;">answer1</span>','<span style="color: #ff0000;">answer2</span>'] #correct 'expected' answer&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;acceptable = ['<span style="color: #ff0000;">answer3</span>','<span style="color: #ff0000;">answer4</span>']&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;ok = False #student is wrong by default&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;overall_message = ''&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>#check that inputs are of acceptable form&nbsp;<br /></code>&nbsp;if answer[0] not in acceptable or answer[1] not in acceptable:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; overall_message = "<span style="color: #0000ff;">You must enter answer1&nbsp;and answer2, or answer3 and answer4, respectively.</span>"&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;if answer == expect:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; ok = True&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; input_list = [{'ok':ok},{'ok':ok}] # one dictionary for each inputfield&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; return {'overall_message':overall_message,'input_list':input_list}&nbsp;<br />&lt;/script&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>&lt;customresponse cfn="check_function"&gt;&nbsp;<br /></code>&lt;p style="display:inline"&gt;<span style="color: #008000;">Enter your question prompt here for the first text input field</span>&lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;<br />&lt;textline size="12" inline="1"/&gt;&nbsp;<br />&lt;p style="display:inline"&gt;<span style="color: #008000;">and more of your question prompt can go here before the second text input field</span>&lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;<br />&lt;textline size="12" inline="1"/&gt;&nbsp;<br />&lt;p style="display:inline"&gt;<span style="color: #008000;">with this bit of text appearing after your secon text input field.</span>&lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;<br />&lt;/customresponse&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>&lt;/problem&gt;</code></p>
