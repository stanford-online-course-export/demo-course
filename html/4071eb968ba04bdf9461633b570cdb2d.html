<p><strong><em>This tells us that 75% of the N<sub>2</sub> that is fed into the reactor is going unused (i.e. wasted)!&nbsp; As discussed in </em></strong><strong>Module 7<em>, a major goal of chemical process engineers is to &ldquo;beat equilibrium&rdquo;.&nbsp; We can do this by recycling the unused reactants back into the reactor to achieve higher overall conversion of N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Consider: Ammonia Synthesis <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With</span> Recycle.</strong> &nbsp;In order to recycle unused reactants, we need to add a separator to separate the N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> coming out of the reactor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Figure 10-2, Ammonia synthesis with recycle" src="/static/Figure_10-2.JPG" /></div>
<p><strong>Define: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">single-pass conversion</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">overall conversion</span></strong></p>
<p>It is useful to differentiate between two conversions: the <em>single-pass conversion</em> for a single pass through the reactor and the <em>overall conversion</em> for the overall process.&nbsp; These are illustrated in the above PFD.</p>
<p>\[ single-pass\ conversion=\ \frac{moles\ reactant\ \bf{reacted\ in\ reactor}}{moles\ reactant\ \bf{fed\ to\ reactor}} \]</p>
<p>\[ overall\ conversion=\ \frac{moles\ reactant\ \bf{reacted\ in\ process}}{moles\ reactant\ \bf{fed\ to\ process}} \]</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s again assume we have a stoichiometric feed of N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> and the same single-pass conversion (0.25) through the reactor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also assume that we have a perfect separator such that our recycle stream contains only N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> and our product stream contains only NH<sub>3</sub>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>For this idealized process, what is our overall conversion assuming that we have the same productivity as our process without recycle?&nbsp; We find that we can achieve an overall conversion of 1!&nbsp; (Real processes can come close to this with overall conversions of 0.98-0.99.)&nbsp;&nbsp; We can achieve the <strong><em>same productivity</em></strong> as the process without recycle while getting <strong><em>complete conversion</em></strong> of our stoichiometric feed.</li>
