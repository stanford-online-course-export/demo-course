<p>Censorship in the Libraries<br /><br />'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' --Katherine Paterson, Author<br /><br />Post a persuasive discussion below as if you were sending it to a newspaper, reflecting your views on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading.<br /><br />Replies to your discussion should critique your post with the following criteria in mine: conciseness, clarity of thought, and form.</p>
