<h2>Introduction to Tables of Contents</h2>
<p>You can add a Table of Contents to your videos to let students navigate easily to the part they are interested in. A Table of Contents is similar to a transcript in that both&nbsp;contain clickable links that are tied to specific points in the video. It is possible to&nbsp;provide&nbsp;a Table of Contents in addition to&nbsp;a timed transcript &ndash; users switch between the two with the CC button in the video player. Take a look at&nbsp;the screenshot below to see what a Table of Contents&nbsp;looks like in practice:</p>
<p><img src="/static/VideoTOC.png" alt="" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" preventdefault="function (){i.isDefaultPrevented=n}" stoppropagation="function (){i.isPropagationStopped=n}" stopimmediatepropagation="function (){i.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n}" isdefaultprevented="function t(){return!1}" ispropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" width="787" height="499" /></p>
