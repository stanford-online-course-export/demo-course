<p>Use the space below to talk about something, anything, in a focused environment. &nbsp;This discussion you participate in will be accessible from here and also from the <a href="https://class.stanford.edu/courses/StanfordOnline/OpenEdX/Demo/discussion/forum/8ce9affb98734f5f8c24153d28ba8dde/threads/5487767a03ff2217bc00000b" target="[object Object]">Discussion page here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>* Note that because we have enabled Cohorting in the demo course, you will automatically be assigned to one cohort group or another. &nbsp;As an admin or member of the course staff, you will see all discussions. &nbsp;Otherwise, for everyone else, this means that in the below discussion component, you will see discussion posts added by other people assigned to the same cohort group as you, but you won't see discussions added by people in a different cohort group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about setting up cohorted discussions in your class, see the EdX documentation: <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/cohorts/index.html" target="[object Object]">http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/cohorts/index.html</a>.&nbsp;</p>
