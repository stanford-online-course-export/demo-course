<p>Before you can create content experiments, you must specify at least one group configuration for your course.</p>
<p>A group configuration defines how many groups of students are in an experiment. You can have any number of group configurations in your course. When you create a content experiment, you select the group configuration to use.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to do one content experiment that presents either a video or a reading assignment to your students, and another content experiment that presents the same question using four different problem types. For the first content experiment, you would need a group configuration that assigns your students to two groups, and for the second content experiment, you would need a group configuration that assigns your students to four groups.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The edX Platform assigns students to each group in a group configuration.</p>
<p>Group assignments are:</p>
<h3>Dynamic</h3>
<p>The edX Platform assigns a student to a group the first time he or she views a content experiment that uses the group configuration.</p>
<h3>Random</h3>
<p>You cannot control which students are assigned to which group.</p>
<h3>Evenly distributed</h3>
<p>The edX Platform keeps track of the size of groups and assigns new students to groups evenly. For example, when there are two groups in a configuration, each group will include 50% of the students in the course; when you have four groups, each group will include 25%.</p>
<h3>Permanent</h3>
<p>Students remain in their assigned groups regardless of how many content experiments you set up that use the same group configuration.</p>
