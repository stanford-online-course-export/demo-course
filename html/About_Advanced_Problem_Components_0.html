<h2>About Advanced Problem Components</h2>
<p>A template for each of the Advanced Problems, similar to the Common Problems, is provided by default, so that you have a helpful starting point. Click on a green component button from within a unit, then select "Advanced" to add any of the Advanced Problem Components to your unit. A default problem will populate the component, and can be edited so that it becomes a problem appropriate to your course.</p>
<p>Unlike the Common Problems, clicking to edit an advanced problem will take you directly to the Advanced Editor, where you can edit the problem in XML.</p>
