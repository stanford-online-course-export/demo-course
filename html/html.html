<p>This second one is the code that was used to create the graded, free text response that has a minimum word requirement (10, in this case) set in the problem code.<br /><br />Like above, take care to match the names of your problem in the above-noted locations.&nbsp; <br /><br />To change the maximum or minimum word requirement, edit this line:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">return len(words) &gt;= 10</p>
<p>This line&nbsp;means "greater than or equal to" 10. &nbsp;Replace 10 with a number of your choice.</p>
