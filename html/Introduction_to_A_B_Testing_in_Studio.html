<p>A/B testing is a great way to see what works and what doesn't in a course. You may want to offer slight variations on practice problems&nbsp;to your students and see which ones&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;better results. Or you may want to show different video content - say a shorter versus a longer video - in order to see which ones students retain more information from. This function allows you to set up such a test in your course and see what happens when randomly assigned participants view one version versus another. You can see an example of an A/B test in the next Unit.</p>
<p>There are two ways to implement A/B testing. The easier method is to go through Studio, as detailed in the following subsections. This method allows you to create Unit-level experiments. The more involved method requires exporting your course, changing the XML, and importing it again. That method allows you to create Unit- or Subsection-level experiments, but it is also very inflexible (you can't make changes once you've created the experiment). For detailed steps on that process,&nbsp;<a href="https://class.stanford.edu/courses/StanfordOnline/OpenEdX/Demo/courseware/Section_one/64e926eb457f46f9827f0929b727b665/" target="[object Object]">go to the Section called "A/B Testing with XML."</a></p>
<p>Note that it is not currently possible to have problems within an A/B test be graded assignments.</p>
