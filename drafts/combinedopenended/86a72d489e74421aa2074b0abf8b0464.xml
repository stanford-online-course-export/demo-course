    <h3>Cloning Human Skin Cells</h3>
    <p>On April 7, 2014, NPR (and other news agencies) broadcast that scientists had successfully cloned an adult male's embryonic stem cell.  NPR's article can be seen in full at <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/04/17/303658757/first-embryonic-stem-cells-cloned-from-a-mans-skin">npr.org/blogs/health/...</a>.  This news carries with it broad implications.
      <br/><br/>    
      While previously studies have informed the public of the ability to clone animal cells (remember "Dolly"?), no successful stories had come forth about human cells, in particular adult human cells.  That scientists have now successfully cloned an adult male's skin cell means that the ability to create tissue - brain cells, for example - is only a few steps away.
