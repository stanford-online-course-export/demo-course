  <p>The answer to this question is \(2y\sin x\cos x\), which is also \(y\sin(2x)\). But your solution will be marked incorrect if you forget to explicitly denote multiplication using "*". E.g., don't type "\(2x\)" if what you really mean is \(2\ast x\). </p>

      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>We're differentiating with respect to \(x\), so we treat \(y\) as a constant. Then we apply the chain rule to deal with the square, and recall that \(\frac{d}{dx}\sin x = \cos x.\) So
\[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}y\sin^2 x = y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\sin^2 x=y\cdot 2\sin x\cdot \frac{d}{dx}\sin x = 2y\sin x\cos x.\]
Recalling the trig identity, \(\sin(2t) = 2\sin t \cos t\), we can
rewrite our solution as \(y\sin(2x)\). (Did you remember to type "*" between \(y\) and \(\sin(2x)\)? Did you remember to type "*" between \(2\) and \(x\)?)</p>
