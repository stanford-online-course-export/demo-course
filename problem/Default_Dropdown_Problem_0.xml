<problem url_name="Default_Dropdown_Problem_0" display_name="Default Dropdown Problem" markdown="null">
  <p>Dropdown problems give a limited set of options for students to respond with, and present those options in a format that encourages them to search for a specific answer rather than being immediately presented with options from which to recognize the correct answer.</p>
  <p>The answer options and the identification of the correct answer are defined in the <b>optioninput</b> tag, if you view the content in the Advanced mode.</p>
  <p>To create the following problem, you would first add a problem component, select "Dropdown" and then edit the content of the component, which looks as follows:</p>
  <p>
    <pre>
      <code>&gt;&gt;Translation between Dropdown and __________ is extremely straightforward:&lt;&lt;

[[(Multiple Choice), Text Input, Numerical Input, External Response, Image Response]]

      </code>
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>Specifying the correct response is done by placing the text of the correct response within parentheses.</p>
  <p>Translation between Dropdown and __________ is extremely straightforward:</p>
  <optionresponse>
    <optioninput correct="Multiple Choice" label="Translation between Dropdown and __________ is extremely straightforward:" options="('Multiple Choice','Text Input','Numerical Input','External Response','Image Response')"/>
  </optionresponse>

      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Multiple Choice also allows students to select from a variety of pre-written responses, although the </p>
      <p>format makes it easier for students to read very long response options. Dropdowns also differ</p>
      <p>slightly because students are more likely to think of an answer and then search for it rather than </p>
      <p>relying purely on recognition to answer the question.</p>
