  <p>Use randomized variables n1 and n2 in any part of this exercise to create a randomized question for your students, where the randomized variables will differ when a student either submits their response, clicks to reset the problem, or when a different student looks at the same problem (depending on how you've set it up).</p>
  <p>Make sure to have at least two randrange values, and also to visit the Settings section of your problem, and set the "Randomization" value to something other than "Never."</p>

  <p>What is $n1 divided by $n2?</p>
  <numericalresponse answer="$total">
    <responseparam default="2%" type="tolerance"/>
    <textline/>
  </numericalresponse>
  <solution>
    <div><p>Using MathJax, you can see the correct corresponding randomized answer below:</p>
       \[ $n1 / $n2 = $total \]
     </div>
  </solution>
