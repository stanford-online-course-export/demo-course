    "So everybody worked on this, and then we got everyone to just come up and put one", 
    "of their solutions on the board, which they were happy to do.", 
    "And they became excited. They were totally engaged by the", 
    "activity, which actually is a great one, because it practices a number of", 
    "operations, but it does that through an inquiry approach.", 
    "So that was a low-stress beginning, for them coming up to the board, and we", 
    "gradually got them more used to it. We wanted them to have voice, so we gave", 
    "them all blank notebooks. And we asked them the decorate them, make", 
    "them their own. And that was their place for their", 
    "mathematical voice, their ideas. And we didn&#39;t write in their notebooks,", 
    "as it was meant to be their place. But we left feedback for them on Post-It", 
    "notes. So you can see an example of that here.", 
    "We started most days with the number talk, which you know about.", 
    "And those just blew the kids away. They had not known that number problems", 
    "could be solved in so many ways. So our research tells us that students", 
    "are much more successful in algebra if they&#39;ve learned about ways to break", 
    "numbers apart, as we talked about. If they know, for example, that 13 is the", 
    "same as 5 plus 8 and they&#39;re fluent in those ways of thinking, well, 13 equals 5", 
    "plus 8, then it helps them learn about algebraic", 
    "expressions, such as a equals b plus c. We collected a lot of data to understand", 
    "how this different maths approach for the students impacted their learning.", 
    "So this is a list of the different data we collected.", 
    "So we had their summer school applications,", 
    "which had data from their teachers. Lesson observations,", 
    "all the lessons were observed. Students completed lots of surveys and", 
    "reflections. We interviewed students.", 
    "35 during the summer, and 15 in the fall. And then we analyzed all their class", 
    "materials, posters, work, what they produced.", 
    "And then we also had results of MARS assessment.", 
    "So, we hadn&#39;t intended to give a post test, as these students came from", 
    "different grades, different schools. They hadn&#39;t worked on the same things.", 
    "But we found out that all students had taken the MARS assessment at the end of", 
    "their previous term. That&#39;s an assessment that comes from the", 
    "Mathematics Assessment Resource Service. It&#39;s a normal, average, sort of normal", 
    "school-like test but it&#39;s much better and more conceptual than other school math", 
    "tests I&#39;ve seen. So the end of five weeks we gave them the", 
    "same questions, the algebra questions, and the students scored with a 24%", 
    "increase which was significant, a significant increase.", 
    "And that was great, although our intention was less to improve", 
    "content as to teach them to engage in maths with a positive inquiry", 
    "relationship that they could take forward.", 
    "So, probably the greatest sign of a change in engagement during the five", 
    "weeks for me was their change in behavior.", 
    "At the beginning they shuffled in to the first class, they had their hoods up.", 
    "They sat down. They didn&#39;t want to talk.", 
    "They only were interested in talking about social issues,", 
    "not maths. But by the end it was amazing.", 
    "They were jostling at the door to get into the room and then rushing to get at", 
    "the problem or the pattern tiles they had worked on for 90 minutes the previous", 
    "day and continue on with it.", 
    "It was really great. So, we saw a couple of surveys from the", 
    "first day. Here are", 
    "two of the same students giving their response after the five weeks.", 
    "So we asked, how does this class feel compared to other math classes you&#39;ve", 
    "been in? And she said, it&#39;s a lot funner and more", 
    "interesting. And I&#39;m actually learning something about", 
    "math. And we asked, has it been more or less", 
    "useful? And she said more.", 
    "Because, in a regular math class, you have to do everything the teacher&#39;s way.", 
    "And sometimes, I don&#39;t get it. And in here, I could do the problems", 
    "whatever way I want. And that was super-important to many of", 
    "the students, that freedom to work on problems the way that they wanted to.", 
    "And then the, another student saying, this is way better than any other math", 
    "class I&#39;ve been in. You participate more, and you work", 
    "together. So that was interesting because those two things, participate", 
    "more and collaborate, were the two biggest things that came out as powerful", 
    "for most of the students. So one activity we worked on was a famous", 
    "activity called the painted cube. Here&#39;s the activity for you to do.", 
    "This is a long activity, but if you have time, stop and work on it now, because", 
    "it&#39;s great. And try and describe the function that", 
    "comes out of this. You can see, it on a graph, if you want", 
    "to plot it on a graph, you&#39;ll see that it isn&#39;t linear.", 
    "And it&#39;s kind of exciting to see that function.", 
    "So every time I use this problem with students from seventh grade up to", 
    "Stanford freshmen, they see the problem in many different", 
    "ways. It&#39;s really fascinating.", 
    "And I can&#39;t show you the video of my seventh and eighth grade students,", 
    "but I have some really nice video of my freshmen class working on this problem,", 
    "which we can look at now. And my question for you is, what features", 
    "of this problem do you think enabled the learning that came out?", 
    "Which aspects of algebra are being worked on here?", 
    "Jo: This is like, how we like to work on math together.", 
    "You&#39;ve been really great at following some of these norms we developed.", 
    "And, the different posters show some of the math problems.", 
    "Student: And, we found that there was the same", 
    "equations that you guys all found.", 
    "But then Joe came by and asked us to explain how we got our center cube.", 
    "And Alonna, Alonna didn&#39;t really, like, do a good job of explaining, so like, if", 
    "you imagine this is a three by three cube sugar block, she said that you would", 
    "knock off faces, until you are left with a cube inside.", 
    "Next student: It sort of goes with the onion thing.", 
    "Like, if you have let&#39;s say, a four by", 
    "four cube. I&#39;m going to take off this slice, this", 
    "slice, a slice from the top, a slice from the bottom, and a slice from each side.", 
    "And then on the inside, there&#39;s a cube left.", 
    "I don&#39;t know. It, it&#39;s hard to show.", 
    "Next student: Yeah, I just made this as a visual", 
    "way to represent it.", 
    "And to show all the different, types of cubes that are represented.", 
    "And so, like, this is one layer.", 
    "This is two layers and this is three layers.", 
    "But you can see like even the cubes on the inside.", 
    "And so this, this would be like the cube that doesn&#39;t have any sides painted.", 
    "And then these would be the eight corners that have three sides painted.", 
    "These would be the faces that have one sides painted, one side painted, and then", 
    "the pink would be the two sides painted, and so it&#39;s just, like, representing 3D", 
    "on the 2D space.", 
    "Teacher: And just to help with the visualization,", 
    "the computer really helps. This is,", 
    "so this is just a demonstration using Mathematica on Wolfram.", 
    "And, so this a 2 by 2 by 2 and it&#39;s pretty transparent so you can see the", 
    "corners. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.", 
    "Looking at the corners, you can count the faces.", 
    "1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There&#39;s a face on the bottom. And it&#39;s", 
    "helpful to see that those properties really don&#39;t change, you know, the", 
    "number of faces is staying the same, even as I increase the number of number of", 
    "total cubes. So the number of corners is going to be", 
    "constant, the number of faces is going to be constant, and even the number of edges", 
    "is going to be constant. It also helps in visualizing the", 
    "idea that there&#39;s a an inside cube. So.", 
    "New student: Yeah, so, this isn&#39;t quite accurate then I guess.", 
    "Yeah, okay I&#39;m confused about, about the drawing [all laugh]", 
    "Other student: But it really helped you.", 
    "First student: Yeah, but, but the drawing helped us", 
    "to visualize it.", 
    "Jo: Okay so don&#39;t, try not to repeat things other people have said, see if you", 
    "can add something different or different ways of seeing it.", 
    "Student: Okay, so first, we did like the 3 by 3, and", 
    "then we wrote what we found there. And then, we did the 4 by 4 but we didn&#39;t", 
    "actually have enough cubes, so sad day for us.", 
    "So we actually like, we didn&#39;t count", 
    "things. We had to like find patterns, and so once", 
    "we started like, how we saw? Yeah, okay.", 
    "So, like, for the three by three, we had six, one color, and then 24 for the four.", 
    "So, we actually found that it was 6 times 1, and then 6 times 4, is how we got it,", 
    "because you have, for the one color, these are the ones that, like,", 
    "are just in the middle of the face. So like here, you got like no color face.", 
    "And so we&#39;re looking for the middle because you can&#39;t count the edges because", 
    "we just want the middle of the face. So it&#39;s a defining area, that&#39;s going to", 
    "be this times that. So, you have five, right, and then", 
    "because you can&#39;t count this row or this row, it&#39;ll be five minus two.", 
    "And then, same thing up here, so you have five.", 
    "And then you can count this or this, and then that&#39;s going to be 5 minus 2 then,", 
    "so it&#39;s just going to be n minus 2 squared.", 
    "should describe how like the inside, just", 
    "slicing off a layer.", 
    "Other student: I agree.", 
    "[Talking]", 
    "Student: I don&#39;t know because, I think, if we", 
    "go up one more.", 
    "Other student: This relationship..", 
    "Student: Yeah, yeah, I don&#39;t, I&#39;m not quite sure how to put this...", 
    "But, if, yeah, this, like if we, if", 
    "we use a base of two,", 
    "this represents, like, two to the", 
    "zero, two to the one, two squared, and two cubed, the amount it changes by.", 
    "And so, and I figure, like, there&#39;s", 
    "some blank coefficient times n squared, or n cubed, sorry.", 
    "n to the first. Or n to the zero.", 
    "And I&#39;m trying to find the coefficient for each one of these.", 
    "Other student: Well it&#39;s like N, but I feel like you can", 
    "make this formula a lot of different", 
    "ways, but I feel like if you do N over two, so", 
    "that&#39;s eight.", 
    "Or it&#39;s just n times 6.", 
    "Because so here it&#39;s 12, right? Or is it just N times four?", 
    "Student: So, I don&#39;t know if this makes sense but", 
    "does N minus two, times four, times three, work?", 
    "Other voice: Wait, five cubed, what&#39;s five cubed?", 
    "125, right?", 
    "So that would be two. That does work.", 
    "Why does it work?", 
    "Other student: Because so there&#39;s two.", 
    "Student: Where&#39;d you get the three from?", 
    "Student: The three? Because, the way we did it was like, we added, we took", 
    "Other student: The three faces.", 
    "Yeah.", 
    "Student: And then four, where&#39;s the, four?", 
    "Because there&#39;s four different things.", 
    "Other student: Yeah, four different things.", 
    "Student: We should try it with 5 afterwards, because -- there should be 69 ones with 2.", 
    "Other student: What do you mean we should try it", 
    "with 5?", 
    "Student: Like if we come up with a formula to find the ones with two, we can probably", 
    "narrow it down", 
    "to there has to be 69. Like basically, all the other stuff in there, like for 5, right?", 
    "Other student: There has to be 69 what?", 
    "Student: Ones with two. For five, and just basically all the", 
    "other stuff we know, like, there has to be eight, there has to be...", 
    "Other student: Three times twelve. Wouldn&#39;t that be...wait.", 
    "Where&#39;d you, I&#39;m just confused. Where did you get the 69?", 
    "Student: Oh, okay.", 
    "Other student: Because for two, we got the formula,", 
    "n minus 2 times 4 times 3.", 
    "Student: Yeah.", 
    "Oh for? No. I don&#39;t know like, it seems like, like,", 
    "we can like figure out all the other things and then figure out what the two", 
    "would be for five. &#39;Cuz like we came up with stuff for all", 
    "the others right?", 
    "Maybe I did this wrong. So like, for five, there&#39;s going to be"
