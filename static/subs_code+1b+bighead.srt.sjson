    "In this section, I want to get to the point where you", 
    "can write some code, and run it, and see what it does.", 
    "Everything in the computer really comes down", 
    "to code running, that's how stuff happens.", 
    "And so, in order to understand the nature of computers, well, you", 
    "have to run code a little bit and see how it works.", 
    "Not like a million lines of code, just a little bit of code.", 
    "That's how we're going to do it in CS101.", 
    "Now, before I get to the code, I'm going to have", 
    "to, have to ask for a little bit of patience.", 
    "The code elements that I'm going to show you", 
    "here are just, they're not flashy, they're very simple.", 
    "It's maybe a little sort of like Lego bricks.", 
    "I have to show you a couple basic", 
    "bricks that individually don't really do anything, but", 
    "later we're going to be able to put", 
    "them together and do stuff that's just fantastic.", 
    "Just by way of foreshadowing: within a few hours,", 
    "you'll be able to write code that manipulates images.", 
    "Such as for example here we have the monkey, moon and banana.", 
    "So there's something to look forward to, but for today it's just very simple.", 
    "Javascript is a computer language.", 
    "There's a lot of different computer languages you", 
    "can use to tell the computer what to do.", 
    "Javascript is the one we're going to use in CS 101 or it's actually JavaScript", 
    "plus a little bit of extra stuff that I put in just for CS 101.", 
    "CS 101 does not cover the entire JavaScript", 
    "language, this is not a full professional programming class.", 
    "Instead I've picked out just a few features just the minimum that we need", 
    "in order to play with the key ideas to really understand how computers work.", 
    "All right, so here's our first example.", 
    "So, this rectangle has code in it, you can type in here.", 
    "And when I click the run button what the computer does is it just runs", 
    "it, it does that, does that and just goes through them, and does whatever I say.", 
    "In this case, the first thing we're going to see is the print function, and", 
    "that tells the computer to print something over here to, on the right hand side.", 
    "So it has the word print and then its followed by a left parenthesis and then", 
    "after the parenthesis, we just type out whatever", 
    "it is, we want the computer to print.", 
    "So in this case, we just see a six and so over here, on the right, it prints a six.", 
    "If I were to change that to a 123 and then run it sure enough we get a 123 over here.", 
    "You can have multiple things in within the", 
    "parentheses here, so I can they're separated by commas.", 
    "So if I said ,2,12 and I run it, and we'll get those things.", 
    "So you can see there's also a print one, two down here showing that.", 
    "So this is, this is very kind of limited, but that's our first thing, print.", 
    "And it also gives you a little example of just the interaction", 
    "between code and a run button that causes the computer to do it.", 
    "Now, the syntax that you see here, is very limited.", 
    "It's not like you can just write out some sentence free form.", 
    "The computer will just figure out what you mean.", 
    "It's really quite the opposite.", 
    "There's a small number of words that the computer", 
    "understands here and you have to use one of those.", 
    "And then also the other bits of syntax like the fact", 
    "that there's a left parenthesis here and a right parenthesis there.", 
    "All those things are required.", 
    "And the have to, everything has to be written out just,", 
    "just so for the computer to be able to understand it.", 
    "That is not just a gratuitous limitation of the code.", 
    "Instead the code is limited sort of as a reflection of the inner sort", 
    "of mechanical, sort of stupidity of the", 
    "computer that I was talkin' about last time.", 
    "So it is not an accident that the code, in order for the computer to", 
    "be able to understand it, has to be in this sort of mechanical, strict form.", 
    "The good news is that because it's kind of simple, it's not", 
    "very hard for us to use, it's just a little bit foreign.", 
    "But I like to think of that as sort of oh well that's", 
    "giving us a little insight about the mechanical, simple nature of the computer.", 
    "Anyway, the good news is you can, you can get used to it.", 
    "It looks weird but really it's pretty simple.", 
    "All right, so let me introduce a second bit of code here.", 
    "Oh, before they do that I have a reminder to myself here.", 
    "So, as I mentioned before, each video comes with this document so", 
    "you could pause the video right now and go visit the document.", 
    "And in the document, all these things with the", 
    "run button and the code you can just try", 
    "yourself, or of course maybe later after a lecture", 
    "you could go and try do it as review.", 
    "All right, so here's our second bit of code.", 
    "So I'll run this, so it says \"6, hi\".", 
    "And that \"hi\" in between double quotes, that's a string.", 
    "So, in computer code, a string is a, just a series of letters.", 
    "And in the code it's written in between double quotes.", 
    "So there's the word hi, or I could change it to, woo hoo within double quotes.", 
    "When I run it, it's going to print the woo hoo over here.", 
    "So, you can imagine strings, strings and numbers, are", 
    "the two very common data types in computer code.", 
    "You can imagine a string is used, maybe to hold", 
    "a URL or a paragraph, if you are typing something.", 
    "All that sort of text manipulation, is stored as strings in a computer.", 
    "That's just a second data type that we're going to be", 
    "able to use to tell the computer how to do stuff.", 
    "Another thing that we see here is a comment.", 
    "So, a comment begins with two slashes like that", 
    "and it just runs to the end of the line.", 
    "And in the comment, you can just sort of write notes to", 
    "yourself, what you intended or what's going on and the computer, when", 
    "we click the run button, the computer just knows to ignore the", 
    "comment so it's just a way of decorating the code with little remarks.", 
    "All right, so I can put different things in here.", 
    "If I say hello or whatever, whatever I put in there,", 
    "it's just a string so that it can get printed out.", 
    "One sort of funny example I could do here is", 
    "what if I put the word print in there, since", 
    "that is also the name of the function over here,", 
    "so we can see what that does, just try it.", 
    "Click the run button.", 
    "It just puts, it just prints print there.", 
    "So when letters that I type are include, are enclosed by", 
    "double quotes like this, the computer", 
    "understands that they're just passive data.", 
    "And it just handles them the regular way.", 
    "It doesn't get confused by what word I put in there.", 
    "So, a key message here about syntax.", 
    "I talked about syntax a little bit before about how it's mechanical.", 
    "But there's a pattern with when you write code that", 
    "involves the syntax and that is when you just write in", 
    "code, oh print this or whatever, it's very common even for", 
    "very professional programmers it's very common to have little syntax errors.", 
    "And so, when the professional programmer hits the run button,", 
    "it's very common, oh there'll be a couple syntax errors.", 
    "And the program is just going to go in and fix those.", 
    "Very quickly, and think nothing of it.", 
    "It's just a quick, superficial, little process.", 
    "The reason I'm mentioning this, is when someone is just beginning with code,", 
    "of course, they're going to run into", 
    "syntax errors 'cause that's the common thing.", 
    "I think they can get the mistaken impression that the", 
    "syntax error means oh, wow, I really don't understand this.", 
    "I, you know, no one else has this trouble.", 
    "And that couldn't be farther from the truth, everyone has syntax errors.", 
    "It's just something you fix very quickly.", 
    "So, to promote this idea that the syntax error is just no big deal,", 
    "and I want to show you how to fix it, I've prepared some examples here.", 
    "Just a bunch of code examples all of which have syntax errors.", 
    "And I just want to sort of work through the process of identify and fixing them.", 
    "So each one of these blocks of code is", 
    "supposed to produce this little a, b, b, c, c,", 
    "c printout and each one of these has an error", 
    "and I just want to go through you know, fixing them.", 
    "All right so let's try clicking this try this first one.", 
    "Let's see so we're getting this error message.", 
    "Sometimes the error messages are helpful, and sometimes, they're just confused.", 
    "So, but you should at least read the error message.", 
    "So it says, \"Error: prlnt is not defined.\"", 
    "Not defined means it's a word but that the computer doesn't know that word.", 
    "So if I look carefully, you'll see here, that", 
    "second one, instead of saying \"print,\" it says prlnt.", 
    "And I chose the l, 'cause it, it looked kind of like an i.", 
    "I was trying to be tricky.", 
    "key there, so I'll put the cursor there, I'll", 
    "just change that to an I, and now I run.", 
    "Okay, it works.", 
    "And let's go [UNKNOWN].", 
    "Error unterminated string literal.", 
    "Not the most friendly phrasing.", 
    "So it has the word string in there, that's a tipoff.", 
    "String literal is this form where you have", 
    "double quote and the string inside the quotes.", 
    "And what you'll see here is unterminated.", 
    "What it means there is, if you look carefully, the second quote.", 
    "The closing quote is just missing.", 
    "The string didn't end.", 
    "So I'll put the quote in there, and I'll run it.", 
    "Okay, now that one's good.", 
    "Let's try this one.", 
    "Error, missing right parenthesis after argument list.", 
    "Oh yeah, sure enough, look.", 
    "So in that case, the error message was just spot on.", 
    "So put the references there.", 
    "All right, I'll try this one.", 
    "Error, missing references after, oh so now in", 
    "this case, I'm looking, the right parenthesis is there.", 
    "Sometimes the error message is just confused.", 
    "At least it's highlighting the right line in this case.", 
    "So you have to look kind of careful.", 
    "I think this one's a little subtle.", 
    "Yeah, print bb it looks right but if you look at", 
    "the next line, see they have this one has the comma.", 
    "It's like oh, right, we're missing the comma after the first item.", 
    "All right, now it works.", 
    "All right, I'll do just one more.", 
    "This one has two syntax errors.", 
    "That's a comment.", 
    "I'll use that.", 
    "Let's see, error, there's the right parenthesis missing.", 
    "I'll run again and there is still an error pront is", 
    "not defined the word it doesn't know so that should be print.", 
    "All right, that works.", 
    "I will leave this one that you can visit if you care to", 
    "and here is also an example problem you can try if you want.", 
    "Sometimes in the document that if you wanted to you could go visit and try.", 
    "So we've seen the print function, how to call it, the basic process of,", 
    "you know, clicking the run button and seeing code run and fixing syntax errors.", 
    "Those are all the things you need to do to write simpler code like this.", 
    "So, for our next step, give it a try yourself on the exercises."
