  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>This Demo Course is intended to help instructors and course teams successfully build online courses through Stanford's OpenEdX platform. Some of what will be covered are things such as navigation, moderation and problem components.</p>
  <p>As this is a living platform (meaning new features are released to Stanford Online from time to time), this course will likely have additional content that may be useful to instructors and their assistants.</p></section>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  <ol style="font:Georgia;">
  <li><em>Navigation</em><br /><br />
The first thing to do is to understand your course site.  Learning about its elements and how to find what you want will create a strong foundation for moving forward with building your course.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><em>Engagement</em><br /><br />
    Various features in OpenEdX enable instructors to better engage their students in the material and with each other.  These include things like videos and discussion forums.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><em>Advanced Components</em><br /><br />
Some components may not be immediately accessible, insofar as how to build or use them.  We'll be adding instructions as well as the code for these kinds of components.<br /><br /></li>
